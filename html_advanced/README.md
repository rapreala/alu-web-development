# HTML Structure Project

The purpose of this project is to create a structurally sound and semantic HTML layout for a webpage, based on a provided designer file on Figma. The project will not involve any CSS or styling, only pure HTML.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through the process of setting up the project and creating the HTML structure.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, you will need to have the following tools installed on your computer:
- A text editor (e.g. Sublime Text, Atom, etc.) for editing the HTML and README files
- A web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, etc.) for previewing the webpage
- An account on Figma (https://www.figma.com/) in order to access the designer file

### Installing

1. Create an account on Figma and access the provided designer file by duplicating it to your drafts.
2. Download the missing fonts, source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT, if your computer does not have them installed.
3. Using the design details provided in Figma, create the HTML structure of the webpage without any CSS or styling.
4. Round any float values as necessary.
5. Create a README.md file to document the process and any important information regarding the project.

### Tips

- It is important to focus on creating a semantic and structurally sound HTML layout, rather than worrying about aesthetics.
- Use proper HTML tags (e.g. header, nav, main, article, etc.) to create a semantic structure for the webpage.
- Pay attention to the design details provided in Figma, such as font sizes, colors, and spacing.
- Keep the HTML code organized and well-formatted for ease of readability and debugging.

## Deployment

Once the HTML structure is complete, the webpage can be previewed by opening the HTML file in a web browser. The final HTML structure can then be integrated into a larger project or used as a standalone webpage.

## Built With

* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - The design tool used to create the designer file
* [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/) - The markup language used to create the webpage structure
